# 🚀 Task Manager - A React Learning Journey

This project is a simple task manager application built to learn and practice fundamental React concepts. As a developer with 6 years of experience in Vue.js, the main goal was to get hands-on experience with React's way of handling reactivity, state management, and component-based architecture.

## ✨ Implemented Features

*   **📝 Task Creation:** Allows users to add new tasks to the list. This feature was key to understanding and using the `useState` hook to manage component state and handle user input.

*   **✔️ Task Completion:** Users can mark tasks as completed, visually distinguishing them from pending tasks. This helped in practicing how to handle user events and conditionally update the UI based on the application's state.

*   **🗑️ Task Deletion:** Users can remove tasks from the list. Implementing this was a great exercise in manipulating arrays within the state and ensuring the component re-renders correctly after a change.

*   **🧩 Component-Based Structure:** The application is divided into smaller, reusable components (like `TaskItem`, `TaskList`, `Header`). This was fundamental to learning how to create and compose components, and how to pass data and functions between them using props.
